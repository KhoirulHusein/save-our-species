# (SOS) save-our-species

## Overview
Indonesia boasts incredibly high biodiversity, encompassing a wide array of wildlife. However, the limited knowledge among the Indonesian population about the country's wild animals poses a significant challenge to wildlife conservation efforts. To address this gap, the SOS project is initiated. SOS aims to leverage modern web technologies to provide a platform for raising awareness and understanding of Indonesia's diverse wildlife.

SOS utilizes React for building user interfaces, Axios for handling HTTP requests, and various other tools and libraries to streamline development. The project's goal is to bridge the knowledge gap, fostering a deeper appreciation for the rich wildlife found within Indonesia. By combining technology with educational content, SOS strives to contribute to the broader conservation initiatives in the region.
